# TODO

- [ ] double flash of "chats" section on initial load
- [ ] chats rename/delete hamburger icon should be inside the chat name wrapper (leave enough padding on the right of the name for the icon to show)
- [ ] make the chat paragraph icons larger, add a gap between them AND/OR move the play icon to the left of the paragraph
- [ ] fix vertical align of transcript header, items too close to the top; `align-items: flex-end`
- [ ] edit session details date is not editable
- [ ] reduce the left and right padding on the chat/transcript section and be consistent with the chats section
- [x] starred messages popover shows below the chats sidebar; should show to the right too
- [ ] when you create a new chat, redirect the UI to that chat page
- [ ] in the sessions sidebar the session link active onclick outline is being cutoff (top and left)
- [ ] add icons on all modals/dialogs, right now only the edit transcript paragraph has them
- [ ] on smaller screens make sure you can still choose a different chat/create a new one; maybe move the chats sidebar into a separate tab much like Chat and Transcript
- [ ] even if you fail to send the message, you should still "try" to save it; as long as it reaches the API we should save it

## Nice to have

- [ ] autocomplete client name when typing in both the create new session and editing an existing one (select dropdown with a free form input too?)
