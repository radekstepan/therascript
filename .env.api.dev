# Purpose: Development environment configuration for the Therascript API (`packages/api`).
# Usage: Loaded via `node --env-file=.env.api.dev ...` (see root package.json `dev:api` script).
# ==========================================================
# DEVELOPMENT Environment for Therascript API
# ==========================================================

# === General Server Configuration ===
# Port the API server will listen on during development.
PORT=3001
# Sets Node.js environment to development (enables more verbose logging, stack traces in errors, etc.).
NODE_ENV=development
# Application mode - 'development' uses REAL backend services (Ollama, Whisper).
APP_MODE=development
# CORS origin for the local UI development server. MUST match the UI server's URL.
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3002

# --- Ollama Configuration ---
# URL where the Ollama service Docker container is accessible.
# 'localhost' works because the container's port is mapped to the host.
VLLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
# Default Ollama model to use for development.
# Consider using a smaller/faster model for quicker responses during dev. Ensure it's pulled.
VLLM_MODEL=gemma3:1b-it-qat
# How long Ollama should keep models loaded in memory after inactivity (e.g., 5m, 1h). Shorter time saves RAM in dev.
VLLM_CHAT_KEEP_ALIVE=5m

# --- Whisper Configuration ---
# URL where the Whisper service Docker container is accessible.
# 'localhost' works because the container's port is mapped to the host.
WHISPER_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
# Default Whisper model for development. Smaller models ('tiny', 'base') are faster but less accurate.
WHISPER_MODEL=tiny

# --- Database & File Storage Configuration ---
# Paths are RELATIVE to the `packages/api` directory.
# Use a separate database file for development to avoid conflicts with production/mock data.
DB_PATH=./data/therapy-analyzer-dev.sqlite
# Directory to store transcript data (currently unused by DB structure, but kept for potential future use).
DB_TRANSCRIPTS_DIR=./data/transcripts
# Directory where uploaded audio files will be stored *temporarily* before processing.
DB_UPLOADS_DIR=./data/uploads

# --- Upload Configuration ---
# Maximum allowed size for uploaded audio files (e.g., 100m, 500m, 1g).
UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE=1g

# --- Mock Mode Specific Configuration (Ignored when APP_MODE is not 'mock') ---
# These settings only apply if APP_MODE is set to 'mock' (e.g., in .env.api.mock).
# MOCK_WHISPER_DELAY_MS=500
# MOCK_OLLAMA_DELAY_MS=800
# MOCK_LLM_MODEL_NAME=mock-llama3:latest
