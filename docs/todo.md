- go through report.md and fix
- do another round of code review
- how does max context work? If unreliable we can hardcode in config per model name
- now that we have max context, could we tweak a prompt in deep analysis map reduce to limit the mapping step so that when reducing we don't run out of memory?
- remove System Prompt from Run Configuration; do these params work per request or when a model is loaded? If so then we need to move this config to where we select a model and its context size
