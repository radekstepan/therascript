#
# Copy this file to .env.api.dev, .env.api.prod, .env.api.mock
# and adjust the values accordingly.
# These files are loaded by Node.js using the --env-file flag
# specified in the root package.json scripts.
#
# Example Usage:
# yarn dev:api         -> uses .env.api.dev
# yarn start:api       -> uses .env.api.prod
# yarn dev:mock:api    -> uses .env.api.mock

# === General Server Configuration ===
# The port the API server will listen on
PORT=3001

# Node environment ('development' or 'production')
# Affects logging, error details, etc.
NODE_ENV=development

# Application operating mode ('development', 'production', or 'mock')
# Determines which services (Ollama, Whisper) are mocked.
# Set this in the specific .env file (e.g., APP_MODE=mock in .env.api.mock)
APP_MODE=development

# URL of the frontend application for CORS policy
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3002

# --- Ollama Configuration ---
# Base URL of the running Ollama instance
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Default Ollama model to use for chat analysis (ensure it's pulled)
# Override in specific .env files (e.g., smaller model for dev/mock)
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3:8b

# How long Ollama should keep models loaded in memory after inactivity (e.g., 5m, 1h, -1 for infinite)
OLLAMA_CHAT_KEEP_ALIVE=5m

# --- Whisper Configuration ---
# URL of the running Whisper (Python FastAPI) service
WHISPER_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Default Whisper model to use for transcription
# Override in specific .env files (e.g., tiny for dev/mock, large for prod)
WHISPER_MODEL=base

# --- Database & File Storage Configuration ---
# IMPORTANT: These paths are relative to the 'packages/api' directory,
#            even though the .env file is in the root. The config loader resolves them.
# Path to the SQLite database file
DB_PATH=./data/therapy-analyzer.sqlite

# Directory to store transcript-related data (if needed, currently unused by DB)
DB_TRANSCRIPTS_DIR=./data/transcripts

# Directory to store uploaded audio files
DB_UPLOADS_DIR=./data/uploads

# --- Upload Configuration ---
# Maximum allowed size for uploaded audio files (e.g., 100m, 500m, 1g)
UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE=1g

# --- Mock Mode Specific Configuration ---
# These are only relevant if APP_MODE=mock is set in the active .env file.

# Simulate Whisper processing time (milliseconds)
# MOCK_WHISPER_DELAY_MS=500

# Simulate Ollama response time (milliseconds)
# MOCK_OLLAMA_DELAY_MS=800

# Name of the model to report in mock Ollama responses
# MOCK_LLM_MODEL_NAME=mock-llama3:latest
