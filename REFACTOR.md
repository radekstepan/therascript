**1. Code Duplication:**

*   **Docker Management Logic:**
    *   Files: `packages/ollama/src/dockerManager.ts`, `packages/whisper/src/dockerManager.ts`
    *   Description: Both files contain very similar logic patterns for managing their respective Docker containers. Functions like `ensureXRunning` and `stopXService` share common steps: finding the container using `dockerode`, checking its state, potentially starting it using `docker compose`, polling for readiness (API health check vs. basic responsiveness), and stopping the container using `dockerode`. This core lifecycle management pattern is duplicated.

*   **API Client Stream Handling:**
    *   File: `packages/ui/src/api/chat.ts`
    *   Functions: `addSessionChatMessageStream`, `addStandaloneChatMessageStream`
    *   Description: These two functions use the `fetch` API to handle streaming responses from the backend. Their implementation is nearly identical, differing primarily in the API endpoint URL they target. This logic could be abstracted into a reusable streaming function.

*   **UI Sidebar List Rendering:**
    *   Files: `packages/ui/src/components/SessionView/Sidebar/SessionSidebar.tsx` (specifically the chat list part), `packages/ui/src/components/StandaloneChatView/StandaloneChatSidebarList.tsx`
    *   Description: Both components render lists of chat items, handle selection/navigation, and include dropdown menus with similar actions (Rename/Edit, Delete). The core pattern for rendering the list, handling clicks/keyboard navigation, and displaying the dropdown is similar.

*   **UI Modal Form Handling:**
    *   Files: `packages/ui/src/components/SessionView/Modals/EditDetailsModal.tsx`, `packages/ui/src/components/StandaloneChatView/EditStandaloneChatModal.tsx`
    *   Description: Both components implement modal dialogs with forms for editing entity details (Session vs. Standalone Chat). They share patterns for managing form state (`useState`), handling input changes, performing validation, and using a mutation hook (`useMutation`) to save changes upon submission.

*   **UI Jotai Sorting Action Atoms:**
    *   Files: `packages/ui/src/store/action/setSessionSortAtom.ts`, `packages/ui/src/store/action/setStandaloneChatSortAtom.ts`
    *   Description: These two write-only Jotai atoms implement the exact same logic for updating sort criteria and toggling sort direction based on user interaction (clicking column headers). They operate on different underlying state atoms (`sessionSort*` vs. `standaloneChatSort*`) but the action logic itself is duplicated.

**2. Configuration Duplication:**

*   **`.gitignore` Files:**
    *   Files: `packages/api/.gitignore`, `packages/ui/src/.gitignore`, `.gitignore` (root)
    *   Description: The API and UI ignore files contain largely overlapping standard Node.js/TypeScript ignore patterns. The root `.gitignore` also shares many of these. While common, it's a form of configuration repetition.

*   **`tsconfig.json` Settings:**
    *   Files: `packages/*/tsconfig.json`
    *   Description: While all packages correctly `extend` the `tsconfig.base.json`, minimizing core duplication, several packages repeat the `compilerOptions.module: "NodeNext"` setting (api, system, ollama, whisper). This is minor due to the `extends` mechanism.

*   **`package.json` Scripts & Dev Dependencies:**
    *   Files: `packages/*/package.json`
    *   Description: Common scripts like `build: "tsc"` and `clean: "rm -rf dist *.tsbuildinfo"` are repeated. Several common development dependencies (`@types/node`, `ts-node`, `typescript`) are listed in multiple packages. This is typical but represents duplication that monorepo tooling (like hoisting) aims to manage implicitly.

*   **`.env.api.*` File Structure:**
    *   Files: `.env.api.dev`, `.env.api.mock`, `.env.api.prod`
    *   Description: These files necessarily define the same *set* of environment variables, differing only in their values based on the environment. This structural repetition is inherent to this configuration approach.

**3. Type/Interface Duplication:**

*   **`OllamaModelInfo` Type:**
    *   Files: `packages/api/src/types/index.ts`, `packages/ui/src/types.ts`
    *   Description: Defined in both the API and UI type files. The structure is identical, although the API's internal representation uses `Date` objects for timestamps while the UI type (and API response schema) uses strings, indicating potential inconsistency.

*   **`DockerContainerStatus` Type:**
    *   Files: `packages/api/src/types/index.ts`, `packages/ui/src/types.ts`
    *   Description: Identical type definition exists in both API and UI type files. Clear duplication.

*   **Conceptual Overlap (Related Types):**
    *   **Chat/Message Types:** `BackendChatMessage`/`ChatMessage` and `BackendChatSession`/`ChatSession`. Structures are very similar, requiring mapping (seen in `ui/src/api/chat.ts`) between backend (DB-oriented) and frontend (UI-oriented) representations.
    *   **Job Status Types:** `WhisperJobStatus`/`UITranscriptionStatus` and `OllamaPullJobStatus`/`UIPullJobStatus`. Represent similar concepts but differ slightly in naming and potentially fields included/excluded for the UI.
    *   **Search Result Types:** `FtsSearchResult` (in `chatRepository.ts`) and `SearchResultItem` (UI type). Tightly coupled, with the UI type reflecting the API response schema mapping of the backend result.
