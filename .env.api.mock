# Purpose: Mock environment configuration for the Therascript API (`packages/api`).
# Usage: Loaded via `node --env-file=.env.api.mock ...` (see root package.json `dev:mock:api` script).
#        Used primarily for frontend UI development when real backend services (Ollama, Whisper) are unavailable or not needed.
# ==========================================================
# MOCK Environment for Therascript API (for UI development without real services)
# ==========================================================

# === General Server Configuration ===
# Port the API server will listen on in mock mode.
PORT=3001
# Often run mock mode in a dev-like environment for debugging API logic.
NODE_ENV=development
# CRUCIAL setting: Enables the mock implementations within the API services.
APP_MODE=mock
# Allow the local UI development server to connect.
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3002

# --- Ollama Configuration (URLs/Models largely ignored in mock mode) ---
# These values are usually placeholders as the mock service handles responses internally.
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://mock-ollama-does-not-exist:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=mock-llm # Define a default name, though the mock service uses its own.
OLLAMA_CHAT_KEEP_ALIVE=5m # Keep-alive is irrelevant for mock.

# --- Whisper Configuration (URLs/Models largely ignored in mock mode) ---
# Placeholders, as the mock service simulates transcription.
WHISPER_API_URL=http://mock-whisper-does-not-exist:8000
WHISPER_MODEL=tiny # Define a default.

# --- Database & File Storage Configuration ---
# Paths are RELATIVE to the `packages/api` directory.
# Can often use the same development database file for mock mode, as real services aren't interacting.
DB_PATH=./data/therapy-analyzer-dev.sqlite
DB_TRANSCRIPTS_DIR=./data/transcripts
DB_UPLOADS_DIR=./data/uploads

# --- Upload Configuration ---
# Maximum allowed size for uploads (still relevant for initial validation).
UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE=1g

# --- Mock Mode Specific Configuration (USED when APP_MODE=mock) ---
# Simulate delay for Whisper processing (milliseconds).
MOCK_WHISPER_DELAY_MS=500
# Simulate delay for Ollama responses (milliseconds).
MOCK_OLLAMA_DELAY_MS=800
# Name reported by the mock Ollama service in its responses.
MOCK_LLM_MODEL_NAME=mock-llm
